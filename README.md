## Data Requirements

### On-Chain Data

1. **DEX Pool Data**:
   - Liquidity pool reserves
   - Token pair addresses
   - Fee structures
   - Router addresses

2. **Gas Market Data**:
   - Current base fee
   - Priority fee trends
   - Gas used by similar transactions

3. **Transaction Data**:
   - Pending transactions that might impact opportunities
   - Recently confirmed transactions

### Off-Chain Data

1. **DEX Metadata**:
   - Supported DEXs (Uniswap, Sushiswap, etc.)
   - Protocol-specific parameters

2. **Token Metadata**:
   - Token addresses
   - Decimals
   - Trading pairs

## Data Sources

1. **Ethereum Nodes**:
   - Run your own nodes or use providers like Infura, Alchemy
